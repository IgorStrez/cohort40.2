    <p>
      <strong>Elephantidae</strong> is a family of large, herbivorous proboscidean mammals
      collectively called elephants and mammoths. These are large terrestrial
      mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth modified into tusks.
      Most genera and species in the family are extinct. Only two genera,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant" target="_blank">
        <em>Loxodonta</em>
      </a> (African elephants) and Elephas (Asian elephants), are living.
      The family was first described by John Edward Gray in 1821,[5] and later
      assigned to taxonomic ranks within the order Proboscidea. Elephantidae has
      been revised by various authors to include or exclude other extinct
      proboscidean genera.
